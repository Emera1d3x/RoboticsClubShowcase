## About
The Robotics Outreach Event aims to give Grade 6 and 7 students an engaging introduction to the world of robotics. Student volunteers from our school’s STEM clubs will lead interactive workshops and demonstrations to showcase various aspects of robotics. In addition, an exhibition FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) match will be held between our school’s robotics team and Bethune’s robotics team, giving students an exciting opportunity to see competitive robotics in action. <br>
This is a workshop specially held by Robotics Club. Simple line following car with IR sensors. Car, circuitry, and code will be mostly complete -  the kids will be able to wire a few things and code a line or two, but mainly just getting a feel for things.
